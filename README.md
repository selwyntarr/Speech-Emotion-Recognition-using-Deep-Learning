# Speech Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning

This code is designed to extract audio features from a given audio signal using the Python programming language. The features of audio signals can be extracted through Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and other techniques. These features are commonly used in speech recognition and analysis because they provide information about the characteristics of an audio signal. The source code uses the Librosa library for audio processing and feature extraction and provides a straightforward interface for extracting and visualizing the audio features. Emotion detection through speech recognition has become an increasingly important area of research due to its potential applications in fields such as mental health, customer service, etc.

I've also created a streamlit app for this and deployed it to the web so you can try it out your selfm just click [here](https://speech-emotion-recognition-using-cnn-lstm.streamlit.app).
